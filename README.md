# Digipaali Wemos board

Digipaali (2018-2020) is a public-funded project conducted by HÃ¤me University of Applied Sciences, and Natural Resources Institute Finland, in cooperation with Finnish innovative farms. The project aims to improve the efficiency of silage bale life-cycle management. This repository includes Arduino code running on a Wemos Lolin D1 Mini Pro v2 board that collects ambient, agricultural data, and communicates with RFID eNur 05WL2 to acquire tag IDs

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your development board for programming and testing purposes. 

## Prerequisites
### Hardware (could be replaced with compatible components)
* Wemos Lolin D1 Mini Pro v2 (or any board with Wifi module, and serial interfaces: UART, I2C)
* Amphenol Telaire T9602
* Qwiic GPS module
* eNur 05WL2
* Adafruit_ADS1115

### Software

* C/C++ language compiler

## Installing

Clone the repository or download zip file and extract it, in your desire folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/tqbao98/digipaali-arduino.git
```

In ```final.cpp```, change ```ssid```, ```password```, and ```mqtt_server``` to your own configuration

## Running

### PlatformIO

In ```platformio.ini```, edit ```platform```, ```board```, and ```framework``` to match your hardware. Hit **Build**, then **Upload** to run.

### Arduino IDE

* Remove **#include <Arduino.h>** in ```final.cpp```
* Change file extension from ```.cpp``` to ```.ino```
* Install potentially required library via Library Manager

## Behaviour

* The program connects to configured Wifi and MQTT server.
* It continuously reads RFID tags via the reader module, and published found tags to topic ```nurapisample/epc```
* It sends GPS data every 10s to topic ```path```
* When receiving message from topic ```sensors```, it collects temperature, humidity, GPS (and possiblly dry matter) value, and published them to topic ```todatabase```
